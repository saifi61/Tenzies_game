The Tenzies game is an engaging dice game implemented using React. The objective is to roll ten dice simultaneously, select the dice showing the same number, and continue rolling the remaining dice until all ten dice display the same number. Players have unlimited rolls, allowing for strategic decision-making as they choose which dice to keep and which to roll again.

**Key Features:**

- **Dice Rolling Mechanism:** All ten dice are rolled together, with players able to keep any number of dice showing the same number.
- **Unlimited Rolls:** Players can roll the non-matching dice as many times as needed to achieve the goal of having all dice show the same number.
- **Confetti Animation:** Celebratory confetti effects, powered by the React Confetti library, add a fun and dynamic visual celebration when players win the game.

Built with React, this game provides an interactive and enjoyable experience, blending chance and strategy in a classic dice game format.
